# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Level**: Beginner  
**Database**: `p1_retail_db`

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. This project is ideal for those who are starting their journey in data analysis and want to build a solid foundation in SQL.

## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `p1_retail_db`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,	
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,	
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,	
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
LIMIT 10

### 2. DATA CLEANING

-- Checking for null values --
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE transactions_id IS NULL
```
-- no null values in transactions_id

-- checks for null values--

```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
	transactions_id IS NULL
	OR
	sale_date IS NULL
	OR
	sale_time IS NULL
	OR
	gender IS NULL
	OR
	category IS NULL
	OR
	quantiy IS NULL
	OR
	cogs IS NULL
	OR
	total_sale IS NULL;
```
 -- Delete the null values--

```sql
 DELETE FROM retail_sales
 WHERE 
	transactions_id IS NULL
	OR
	sale_date IS NULL
	OR
	sale_time IS NULL
	OR
	gender IS NULL
	OR
	category IS NULL
	OR
	quantiy IS NULL
	OR
	cogs IS NULL
	OR
	total_sale IS NULL;
```
### 3.-- Data Exploration --

-- How many sales we have?--
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)as total_sale FROM retail_sales
```
-- shows there have been 1997 sales 

-- check how many customers we have --
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)as customer_id FROM retail_sales
```
-- shows 1997 ie includes duplicates 

--- remove duplicates --
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id )as total_sale FROM retail_sales
```
-- shows the total sale by showing no of customers 

--check the different types of category --
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales
```
-- tells us there are 3 categories in our data ie - electronics, clothing and beauty 

-- to get just the no of categories  --
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT category ) FROM retail_sales
```
-- gives 3 (no)

 ### 3. DATA ANALYSIS AND BUSINESS KEY PROBLEMS AND ANSWERS--

-- Retrieve all columns for sales made on 2022-11-05 --
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```
-- shows about 11 sales on that date --

-- Retrieve all transactions where the category is clothing and the quantity sold 
-- ** is more than 4 in the month of nov 2022 **
SELECT * FROM retail_sales WHERE 
category = 'Clothing'
AND quantiy >= 4 
AND TO_CHAR (sale_date,'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'

--**calculate the total sales for each category **
```sql
SELECT category,
SUM(total_sale) 
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category
```
-- find the average age of customers who purchased items from the beauty categoty 
```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(age),2)
FROM retail_sales 
WHERE category = 'Beauty'
```
-- the avg age is 40.4157....
-- round is used to round up the result to upto 2 places 

-- find all transactions where the total_sales is greater than 1000
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM retail_sales 
WHERE total_sale> 1000 
```
-- find the total number of transactions(transaction_id)made by each gender in each category 
```sql
SELECT category, gender,
COUNT(*) 
FROM retail_sales 
GROUP BY category, gender 
ORDER BY 1 -- puts similar things together
```

--** cal the aveage sale for each month, find out best selling month in each year ** 
```sql
SELECT
	year, month, avg_sale
	FROM(

		SELECT
		EXTRACT (YEAR FROM sale_date) as year,
		EXTRACT (MONTH FROM sale_date) as month,
		AVG(total_sale) as avg_sale,
		RANK()OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date)ORDER BY AVG(total_sale)DESC)as rank
		FROM retail_sales
		GROUP BY 1,2 
		ORDER BY 1,3 DESC
	)as t1
	WHERE rank = 1
```
	
-- **find  top 5 customers based on the highest total sales 
-- many customers have shopped repeatedly soo we group by customers and sum the sales for each 
```sql
SELECT  customer_id, 
SUM(total_sale)
FROM retail_sales 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5
```
-- find the no  of unique customers who purchased items from each category 
```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category
```

-- **create each shift and no of orders (eg - morning < 12)
```sql
WITH hourly_sale -- creates a table with shift column 
AS
(
SELECT *, 
CASE 
	WHEN EXTRACT (HOUR FROM sale_time)< 12 THEN 'Morning'
	WHEN EXTRACT (HOUR FROM sale_time)BETWEEN 12 AND 17  THEN 'Afternoon'
	ELSE 'Evening'
	END as shift 

FROM retail_sales)

SELECT shift, 
COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM hourly_sale 
GROUP BY shift 
```
